# Simple Task Templates

## Story

I have a lot of prompts that I often use but I have no place to store them, other then my own notes and copy paste things.
The paid version of ChatGPT allows me to create my own GPTs and Claude allows to save favorite chats.
But it's both not what I want.

Example:
- "My {language} is not very good. Help me sound more natural:\n{some bad language}"
- "Provide feedback on this user story:\n{user story}"

I want a very simple way to create and use such templates. I don't need to chat with a bot.
If I don't like the result I try again or change it myself.
