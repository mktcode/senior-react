# Simple AI Task Templates

## Main

I have a lot of prompts with placeholders that I often use but I have no place to store them, other then my own notes and copy paste things.
The paid version of ChatGPT allows me to create my own GPTs and Claude allows to save favorite chats.
But it's both not what I want. GPTs are too complex and Claude too simple.

Example:
- "My {language} is not very good. Help me sound more natural:\n{text}"
- "I need help with {topic1,topic2,topic3}:\n{description}"
- "Provide feedback on this user story:\n{story}\n\nFocus on {clarity,conciseness,consistency,correctness,completeness,concreteness,coherence}"

I want a very simple solution to manage and use such templates.
I want a form to fill in the placeholders instead of editing the prompt everytime.
I want to make parts of the template optional, so I can enable them only when needed.
I want to chat with a bot to refine the result if necessary.
I want to easily copy the result to the clipboard.

## Secondary

I want to explore templates of others and share my own.
But I want to have my private templates as well.
